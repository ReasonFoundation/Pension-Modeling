## Pension Modeling



```{r }
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(msm)
library(plotly)
source(here("R", "functions.R"))
```

## Population Generation

Inputs:
- Number of Employees
- Entry Age
- Retirement Age
- Age distribution (median age, standard deviation for use in rtnorm function)
- Mortality table for retirees


```{r population_inputs}
pop_size <- 208244
entry_age <- 20
ret_age <- 65
pop_maturity_type <- 'custom'
mean_age_active <- 45.4
sd_age_active <- 15
mort <- 'RP2014_Employee_total'
max_age <- 100

population_actives <- generate_pop_actives(entry_age = entry_age, ret_age = ret_age, pop_maturity_type = pop_maturity_type, pop_size = pop_size, mean_age_active = mean_age_active, sd_age_active = sd_age_active)

mort_tab <- switch(
  mort,
  "RP2014_Employee_total" = 2,
  "RP2000_Employee_total" = 4,
  "RP2010_Employee_total" = 6
)

population_retirees <- generate_pop_retirees(entry_age = entry_age, ret_age = ret_age, mort_tab = mort_tab, population_actives = population_actives)
```

```{r population_histogram, echo = FALSE}
plot_ly(
  x = population_actives,
  opacity = 0.7,
  type = "histogram",
  name = "Current Employees",
  xbins =
    list(start = entry_age, end = max_age, size = 5)
) %>%
  add_trace(
    x = population_retirees, 
    name = "Retirees", 
    type = "histogram",
    xbins = list(start = entry_age, end = max_age, size = 5)) %>%
  layout(
    barmode = "overlay",
    xaxis = list(
      title = 'Age',
      ticks = 'outside',
      range = c(entry_age, max_age),
      showticklabels =
        TRUE,
      showgrid = TRUE
    ),
    yaxis = list(
      title = 'Count',
      ticks = 'outside',
      showticklabels = TRUE
    )
  )
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
